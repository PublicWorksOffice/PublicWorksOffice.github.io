			Public Works Office (PwO) exists to "make technology public"<sup>1</sup>: open, interoperable, inclusive, and user-centric.
		</p>
		<p>
			PwO is a technical consultancy that provides advice related to software product development, technology integration and digital customer experience. 
		</p>
		<p>
			PwO has particular experience with open source (the integration of, as well as developing new communities), systems architecture based on open standards and interfaces, and transportation: trip planners, real-time arrival prediction systems, customer experience, digital signage and content, and data.			
		</p>
		<p>
			At PwO, we believe people come together to do great, big things as one "body". Government is one of the best examples, and we're here to help those on the inside working on great, big things.

		<u>PwO's Values (draft)</u>

		<ol>
			<li>Understand the details. The details are often where opportunity lies: to do something new, to do something faster, to accomplish the goal you set out to achieve.</li>
			<li>Strengthen our clients: like a good camper, leave a place better than you found it. Progress breeds more opportunity.</li>
			<li>Be honest--it's okay to disagree. The truth always wins in the end, why ignore it? Develop a hypothesis about the world and test it.</li>
			<li>Be thoughtful: most often this means helping our clients make the best decision for them given constraints. Nothing is perfect, and nothing is final.</li>
		</ol>

			<sup>1</sup>: "public" in the sense that <em>things</em> encode values in their design. Communiites of experts that make value-laden decisions are not typically venues for engagement by the general public/the entire "body" of people
