		<u>PwO's Values (draft)</u>

		<ol>
			<li>Understand the details. The details are often where opportunity lies: to do something new, to do something faster, to accomplish the goal you set out to achieve.</li>
			<li>Strengthen our clients: like a good camper, leave a place better than you found it. Progress breeds more opportunity.</li>
			<li>Be honest--it's okay to disagree. The truth always wins in the end, why ignore it? Develop a hypothesis about the world and test it.</li>
			<li>Be thoughtful: most often this means helping our clients make the best decision for them given constraints. Nothing is perfect, and nothing is final.</li>
		</ol>
