			Public Works Office (PwO) exists to "make technology public": open, interoperable, inclusive, and human-centric.
		</p>
		<p>
			PwO is a technical consultancy that provides advice related to software product development, technology integration and digital customer experience. 
		</p>
		<p>
			PwO's process begins by understanding our client's bigger organizational goals, translating those goals to a roadmap, and then executing on the roadmap together.

		<u>PwO's Values (draft)</u>

		<ol>
			<li>Understand the details. The details are often where opportunity lies: to do something new, to do something faster, to accomplish the goal you set out to achieve.</li>
			<li>Strengthen our clients: like a good camper, leave a place better than you found it. Progress breeds more opportunity.</li>
			<li>Be honest--it's okay to disagree. The truth always wins in the end, why ignore it? Develop a hypothesis about the world and test it.</li>
			<li>Be thoughtful: most often this means helping our clients make the best decision for them given constraints. Nothing is perfect, and nothing is final.</li>
		</ol>
