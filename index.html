			Public Works Office (PwO) exists to "make technology public"<sup>1</sup>: interoperable, inclusive, user-centric, and often deployed in public spaces. 
		</p>
		<p>
			PwO is a technical consultancy that specializes in 0->1 product development and technology strategy in complex stakeholder environments, frequently touching government or the built environment, and often 
			related to innovation and/or experience-first initiatives. Above all, PwO is thoughtful in its work and approach.
		</p>
		<p>
			Past work has been with public/mass transit operators, engineering firms, concessionaires (e.g. out-of-home advertising), higher education/research institutions, technology firms, real estate and private equity.

		<u>PwO's Values (draft)</u>

		<ol>
			<li>Listen: a big part of thoughtfulness is sharing your opinion, but recognizing needs other than your own. </li>
			<li>Understand the details. The details are often where opportunity lies: to do something new, to do something faster, to accomplish the goal you set out to achieve.</li>
			<li>Strengthen our clients: like a good camper, leave a place better than you found it. Progress breeds more opportunity.</li>
			<li>Be honest--it's okay to disagree. The truth always wins in the end, why ignore it? Develop a hypothesis about the world and test it.</li>
		</ol>

		<div class="callout">
			<img src="brazil.jpeg"/>
			<span>
				PwO is inspired, in part, by Harry Tuttle (right) in <em>Brazil</em> (1985): a former "insider" who works on the outside of big institutions to help those with a need navigate a complicated socio-technical landscape.
